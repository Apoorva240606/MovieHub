- Vote type: `1` = upvote, `-1` = downvote.
- If the user repeats the same vote, it removes the vote.
- If the user changes vote, it updates automatically.

### **Notes**
- Protected routes require a valid JWT token in `Authorization` header.
- Public routes (`GET /movies`, `GET /movies/:id`, `GET /movies/search`) can be accessed without login, but `user_vote` will be returned only for logged-in users.
